# WEBRiP-AUTO, CiRAR team
A part of one of my first big project (before 2012), only in procedural PHP (yes, it's dirty).
The purpose was to automaticaly download blurays from scene, ripping them in SD format, and then upload it on private or public trackers.
The main challenge was to produce good quality rip while racing the other teams.
So an automatic monitor of other team releases was active, and the service was load-balanced on different servers.
